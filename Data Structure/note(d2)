A tuple is just like a list of a sequence of immutable python objects.
container which is immutable=tuple
index=read operation
count=read
append
clear
extend
remove
reverse
sort
insert
pop

using literal=([]/())
/class=(list()/tuple()),without both,using literal seperating by comma

In packing, we place value into a new tuple while in unpacking we extract those values back into variables.
a[2]=a[2]+2=assinging new value to index 2(replace)
a[2]+=2=same indexma 2 add hunxa(value update)

# empty dictionary
my_dict = {}

# dictionary with integer keys
my_dict = {1: 'apple', 2: 'ball'}

# dictionary with mixed keys
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 1: [2, 4, 3]}

# using dict()
my_dict = dict({1:'apple', 2:'ball'})

# from sequence having each item as a pair
my_dict = dict([(1,'apple'), (2,'ball')])

6.. Count the number of spaces in a string
Ans.
s = 'this is python class which is started at 6 oclock.'
len([x for x in s if x ==" "])

7.. Remove all of the vowels in a string
Ans.
s = "broadway"
v = "aeiou"
[i for i in s if i not in v]

8.. Find all of the words in a string that are less than 4 letters 
Ans.
s = 'this is python class which is started at 6 oclock.'
[len(i) for i in s.split() if s.split() < 4]


1. Use a dictionary comprehension to count the length of each word in a sentence.

2. Use a nested list comprehension to find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by any single digit besides 1 (2-9)

3. For all the numbers 1-1000, use a nested list/dictionary comprehension to find the highest single digit any of the numbers is divisible by
